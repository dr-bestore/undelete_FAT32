# Undelete FAT32 based storage system program

This software was a recommendation of my professor Edison Ishikawa for concluding the discipline of Operational Systems.
The said software, hosted inside the win_ver folder, focus on getting a mixed memory of a FAT32 device (the unix_ver folder contains the code to mix the memory) and recover a specific file after deleting it and mixing the memory again without overwriting the desired file.


The code is written in C++ using OO paradigm and compiled using Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC). Feel free to take a look and use it if you need somehow.
